I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree at the [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) (KAIST), where I belong to the [KAIST Hacking Lab](https://kaist-hacking.github.io/). My primary interests are in system security, software exploitation, and vulnerability research. I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and enjoy exploring real-world security issues through hands-on technical work. Recently, I’ve been focusing on how large language models (LLMs) can be used to discover and analyze vulnerabilities. I’m passionate about bridging theory and practice in cybersecurity, and I aim to contribute to both academic research and practical advancements in the field.
